# 📊 Telco Customer Churn Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
Customer churn is a critical challenge in the telecom industry. This project analyzes the **Telco Customer Churn Dataset** to identify key factors influencing churn and to build predictive models for churn detection.  

The project includes:  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding patterns, demographics, and churn behavior.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, encoding categorical variables, handling missing values.  
- **Predictive Modelling**: Building machine learning models to predict churn.  
- **Report**: A detailed business-oriented report summarizing insights and recommendations.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
Key findings from EDA:  
- Churn rate: **26.5%**  
- Senior citizens and customers without dependents are more likely to churn.  
- **Month-to-month contracts** have the highest churn.  
- Customers with **high monthly charges** are at greater risk of churn.  
- **Electronic check** payment method is associated with higher churn.
